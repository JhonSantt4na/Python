"""
Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, 
for each operation add a value to each of the array element between two given indices, inclusive. 
Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in your array.

For example, the length of your array of zeros n = 10. 
Your list of queries is as follows:

a b k
1 5 3
4 8 7
6 9 1

Add the values of 'k' between the indices 'a' and 'b' inclusive:

index->	 1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10
	    [0,0,0, 0, 0,0,0,0,0, 0]
	    [3,3,3, 3, 3,0,0,0,0, 0]
	    [3,3,3,10,10,7,7,7,0, 0]
	    [3,3,3,10,10,8,8,8,1, 0]

The largest value is 10 after all operations are performed.

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers 'n' and 'm',
the size of the array and the number of operations.
Each of the next 'm' lines contains three space-separated integers 'a', 'b' and 'k', 
the left index, right index and summand.

Sample Input
5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100

Sample Output
200
